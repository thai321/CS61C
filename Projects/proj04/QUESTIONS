PROJECT 4 WRITE-UP
------------------

1) Briefly explain how you implemented comparison queries and how they affected your control block's signals (in a few sentences).

If the result is greater, CR is set to 1.
If the result is equals, CR is set to 2.
If the result is less, CR is set to 3.
Otherwise, it's initially 0.

CQControl sub-circuit determines whether the instruction should be executed by comparing ?CQ with ?CR.

LessOrEqual and GreaterOrEqual values are determined by using OR gate on CR value. Then all values except FALSE are OR-ed together. If it's FALSE then it will output 0 either way. Then the result is AND-ed with "start" to see if any comparison has been ever done.  

2) Please list your control block's control signals, and briefly explain what each one does (in a sentence or less each).


A2-type - determines whether the instruction is A2-type
RegWrite - determines whether to write to register.
MemWrite - determines whether to write to memory.
Jump - determines whether it's a JUMP instruction.
Link - determines whether it's a LINK instruction.
JumpReg - determines whether it's a JUMP instruction and it's not and ?IMM is False.

3) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you like?

Comparison is awesome!! <3 <3 <3 #yolo #swag

4) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you not like?

Too easy to implement. Should add floating point unit and parallelization.
