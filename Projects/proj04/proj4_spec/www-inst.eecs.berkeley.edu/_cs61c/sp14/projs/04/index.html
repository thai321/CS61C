    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <ul class="critical">
      <li>The original <tt>RUN.circ</tt> was updated on Thursday April 24 at 12:15 PM. If 
      		you copied this file before then, please retrieve it again (the old version had 
      		a pointless MUX that broke the circuit).</li>
    </ul>
	</div>
    
  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    

<p>In this project, you will be implementing a 2-stage pipelined processor for the Ida 
  assembly language (a language designed specifically for this project!). It is 
  absolutely necessary to thoroughly read through the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a> to be able to complete 
  this project, as there are substantial differences (both simplifications and 
  complications) from MIPS.</p>
  
<p>Before you begin, some points to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is absolutely critical not to move the input or output pins in any of the 
    supplied circuit files.</li>
  <li>You may use any built in components supplied in Logisim, EXCEPT for the built in
  clock pin (instead use the clock signal given as an input to the circuit).</li>
  <li>Make sure you are familiar with the subtleties explained in the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a>. For 
  example: When does sign extension happen? What do comparison queries return before a 
  comparison has occurred?</li>
</ul>


  </div>



  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    

<p>For this project, you should work in groups of two (however, you may work solo). 
You are not allowed to show or share your project files with any other students, friends, 
and such. This includes files you write for testing.</p>

<p>As usual, note that looking at solutions from previous semesters is also strictly 
prohibited. We have various tools at our disposal to detect plagiarism and they are very 
good at what they do.</p>


  </div>



  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Files</h2>
    

<p>Before you begin, copy the start kit to your project 4 directory:</p>
  
<pre class="code input">cp -r ~cs61c/proj/04/* proj04</pre>

<p>The following files are given:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>RUN.circ</b> - contains instruction memory and runs your project; DO NOT MODIFY</li>
  <li><b>REG.circ</b> - contains all general purpose registers</li>
  <li><b>CPU.circ</b> - contains most of the processor, excluding instruction memory.</li>
  <li><b>ALU.circ</b> - performs arithmetic operations</li>
  <li><b>QUESTIONS</b> - contains some questions for you to answer</li>
  <li><b>hex/</b> - contains testing tools</li>
</ul>

  </div>




  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Pipelining</h2>
    

<p>You will be implementing a 2-stage pipeline, specifically including the following stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Instruction Fetch</b> - fetch an instruction from instruction memory</li>
  <li><b>Decode</b> - everything else (decode and execute the instruction, then write back the results)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that data hazards are not present in this design, since every data access from 
any source occurs only in one pipeline stage. However, control hazards must still be 
accounted for. Ida does not expose branch delay slots to software. In other words, the 
instruction immediately after a jump is not necessarily executed if the jump actually 
occurs. By the time you have figured out that a jump is in the execute stage, you have 
already accessed the instruction memory and possibly pulled out the wrong instruction. 
Thus you will need to "kill" the instruction being fetched if the instruction currently 
being executed is a taken jump (which is to say that jumps that are not taken should 
not cause a kill).</p>

<p>Instruction kills for this project MUST be accomplished by MUXing a nop into the 
instruction stream and sending the nop into the execute stage (instead of using the 
fetched instruction). Notice that every Ida instruction contains numerous possible nops 
(every instruction can be turned into a nop using the ?NO comparison query). However, 
you MUST use 0x00000000 as a nop, for grading purposes.</p>

<p>Because all of the control and execution is handled in the Execute stage, your 
processor should be more or less indistinguishable from a single-cycle implementation, 
barring the one-cycle startup latency and the jump delays. However, we will be enforcing 
the two-pipeline design. If you are unsure about pipelining, it is perfectly fine 
(and even recommended) to first implement a single-cycle processor. This will allow 
you to first verify that your instruction decoding, control signals, arithmetic 
operations, and memory accesses are all working properly. From a single-cycle processor, 
you can then split off the instruction fetch stage with a few additions and a few 
logical tweaks.</p>

<p>You might also notice a bootstrapping problem here: during the first cycle, the 
instruction register sitting between the pipeline stages won't contain an instruction 
loaded from memory. How do we deal with this? It happens that Logisim automatically sets 
registers to zero on reset. The instruction register will then contain a nop. We will 
allow you to depend on this behavior of Logisim (which is required as specified in 
the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a>).</p>

  </div>




  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Starting Circuit Files</h2>
    
  <h3>Layout</h3>
  <p>The general layout of the skeleton files is demonstrated with the ALU skeleton file 
  shown here.</p>
  <p><img src="info.png"/></p>
  <p>In this example, the top row contains the actual input and output pins. These must 
  not be moved or changed under any circumstances! Connect to these pins using tunnels.
  Each file also has a helpful group of display probes, which merely display the inputs 
  and outputs in a more readable format. These probes can be ignored, moved, or changed 
  as desired.</p>
  





<h3>REG.circ</h3>

<p>
	  You will design a register file to manage the sixteen 24-bit registers in Ida. After 
	  being told to write data to a particular register, you will be able to retrieve that 
	  data by asking for the value of that register on subsequent clock cycles. 
	</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>

	  <li>There is a third register value output, unlike in MIPS. You will have to figure out 
	  which instructions require reading the values of three registers.</li>
	  <li>Be sure to review the register table in the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a> for any special cases.</li>
	
</ul>

<p>
  <table><thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Input</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
  </thead><tbody>
		<tr><td>reg1Read</td><td>the first register to read from</td></tr>
		<tr><td>reg2Read</td><td>the second register to read from</td></tr>
		<tr><td>reg3Write</td><td>the register to write to, which is also the third register to read from</td></tr>
		<tr><td>writeVal</td><td>the value to write to the specified register</td></tr>
		<tr><td>write?</td><td>enables writing to the register</td></tr>

  </tbody></table>
</p>

CIRCUIT!</p>


  


<h3>ALU.circ</h3>

<p>		
		You will also design an ALU that your processor will use to do math. You will tell 
		your ALU what operation to perform, and it will drive its output with the result of 
		that operation.
	</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>

	  <li>You are allowed to use ANY of Logisim's built-in arithmetic blocks.</li>
	  <li>The two comparison operations are implementation-dependent (you can 
		output any value that works for you), and while they may return fewer than 24 bits, 
		the ALU will still output a 24 bit quantity as always. Review the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a> for 
		details.</li>
		<li>You cannot store any comparison checking in the ALU, because there is no clock 
		input. Including a clock pin in the ALU is not allowed.</li>
		<li>Unlike the ALUs we've studied in the past, this ALU does not have an ALU control 
		input. Instead it takes in the instruction's operation number. The reason for this is 
		that there are 12 unique arithmetic operations in Ida, requiring 4 bits to be 
		passed along in an ALU control signal. Since the operation field is also 4 bits, it 
		is simpler to pass this into the ALU instead.</li>
	
</ul>

<h3>CPU.circ</h3>

<p>
		The CPU contains most of the processor, excluding instruction memory. The reason
		for this involves testing concerns. There are several things to note here:
  </p>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>

    <li>You will have to store the comparison register and the program counter register 
    in this file, and implement it in whichever way you choose.</li>
    <li>Most of the control signals you might use are the same as the MIPS control 
    signals we've studied. However, the choosable register/immediate field described in 
    the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a> will complicate several of these signals.</li>
    <li>Hint: design your control logic carefully. What might happen to your control 
    signals when the comparison query is false?</li>
    <li>You will need to implement data memory here.</li>
	
</ul>

<p>

    <tr>
      <td>Input</td>
      <td>Description</td>

		active, or garbage otherwise; used for debugging and grading only</td></tr>
		<tr><td>memAddr</td><td>the address that would be written to in memory if memory writing is

<h3>RUN.circ</h3>

<p>
	  This test harness contains the remainder of the CPU logic, and is used to run the 
	  processor. Since you will not submit this file, any changes you make will not be 
	  graded.

    <h2>Logisim Notes</h2>
    

<p>It is strongly recommended that you 
<a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/">download Logisim</a> and to run on 
your local machine while developing your processor to avoid overwhelming the 
instructional machines. Though Logisim is relatively stable, it is still recommended 
that you save often, and also make backup copies of your .circ files early and often. 
The official version of Logisim we will be using for evaluation is v2.7.1.<p>

<p>Some Helpful Hints:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are having trouble with Logisim (especially involving blue wires), be
  sure to restart Logisim and reload your circuit! Don't waste your time chasing a bug 
  that is not your fault. However, if restarting doesn't solve the problem, it is more 
  likely that the bug is a flaw in your project.</li>
  <li>Do NOT gate the clock! This is very bad design practice when making real circuits, 
  so we will discourage you from doing this by heavily penalizing your project if you 
  gate your clock.</li>
  <li>BE CAREFUL with copying and pasting from different Logisim windows. Logisim has 
  been known to have trouble with this in the past.</li>
  <li>Changing attributes before placing a component changes the default settings for 
  that component. So if you are about to place many 16-bit pins, this might be 
  desirable. If you only want to change that particular component, place it first before 
  changing the attributes.</li>
  <li>When you change the inputs and outputs of a sub-circuit that you have already 
  placed in an outer circuit, Logisim will automatically add and remove the changed ports 
  when you return to outer circuit, and this sometimes shifts the block itself. If there 
  were wires attached, Logisim will do its automatic moving of these as well, which can 
  be extremely dumb in some cases. Before you change the inputs and outputs of a block, 
  it can sometimes be easier to first disconnect all wires from it.</li>
  <li>Error signals (red wires) are obviously bad, but they tend to appear in 
  complicated wiring jobs such as the one you will be implementing here. It's good to be 
  aware of the common causes while debugging:<br><br><img src="error_wire.png"></li>
</ul>

  </div>


  

  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    

<p>Once you've implemented your processor, you can test its correctness by writing
programs to run on it! This simple program has been provided for you as a basic 
sanity check: <tt>halt.ida</tt>. This program loads the values 1-15 into registers 1-15,
and then attempts to "halt" by performing an infinite loop. If it fails to halt 
(for example, due to an error in your jump computation), it will then set all 
registers to 0.</p>

<p>See the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a> to review how the assembler and emulator works.</p>

<p>After the hex files have been assembled (and hopefully run through the emulator), 
they can be loaded into a logisim RAM unit. Loading a hex file should be done before 
running a simulation normally.</p>

<p><img src="load_hex.png"/></p>

<p>Please note that you are EXPECTED to fully test your circuit as this is the ONLY way 
for you to know if you completed everything correctly. Also note that in the event the 
emulator differs from the behavior defined in the <a href="manual.html">Ida Manual</a>, you should assume the 
manual is correct.</p>



  </div>





  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Submission</h2>
    

<p>Make sure to fill out the questions in the QUESTIONS file before submitting.</p>

<p>You must submit only the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REG.circ</li>
  <li>ALU.circ</li>
  <li>CPU.circ</li>
  <li>QUESTIONS</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this means that none of your circuits may use other external circuits. Submit 
in the usual way:</p>

<pre class="code input">submit proj4</pre>

<p>This project is due in its entirety on Sunday, May 4th, 2014 at 23:59:59.</p>


  </div>


  

  <div class="sect">
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    
<p>This project will be graded in large part by an autograder. Readers will also glance 
at your circuits. If some of your tests fail the readers will look to see if there is a 
simple wiring problem. If they can find one they will give you the new score from the 
autograder minus a deduction based on the severity of the wiring problem. For this reason 
and as neatness is a small part of your grade please try to make your circuits neat and 
readable.</p>
